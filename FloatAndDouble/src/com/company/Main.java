/*Floating-point numbers, also known as real numbers, are used when evaluating
expressions that require fractional precision. For example, calculations such as
square root, or transcendentals such as sine and cosine, result in a value whose
precision requires a floating-point type. Java implements the standard (IEEEâ€“754)
set of floating-point types and operators. There are two kinds of floating-point types,
float and double, which represent single- and double-precision numbers,
respectively. Their width and ranges are shown here:*/
